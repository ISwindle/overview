Class Overview
- The core value of a software developer is business and team contribution
- The class will focus on contribution and not letter or number grades
- The class comprises 5 GitHub projects (keyfair, data-structures-algorithms, interviews, overview, and a personal project).
- We will cover the core topics from the original syllabus, but your growth in the class is driven by contribution to the projects.
- Success is binary. Attend class, contribute to the projects, and you will succeed.
